# React example with MindAR 

This is an example project of using [MindAR](https://github.com/hiukim/mind-ar-js) in React 

The react components are:

1. `src/mindar-viewer` (AFRAME version), 

Everything else are created from `create-react-app`, and they are irrelevant. 

# It demonstrates:

1. how to import MindAR as a npm package
2. how to create a React component for MindAR

# To run
```

> npm run start
```

```
> npm run start-https
```
